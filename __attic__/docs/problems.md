| [#180](https://github.com/wellcometrust/reach/issues/180) | Text found in wrongly identified references section | A table with the row name "Treatment of severe malaria", was identified as a reference title since this table was at the end of the references section and got included in the scraped. | Improve extracting section | 64/103 |
| [#181](https://github.com/wellcometrust/reach/issues/181) | Text found not in a reference during the exact text search | "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder" was found in the text of several documents and identified as a match to a paper with the same name. | Length threshold to exact matcher | 20/103 |
