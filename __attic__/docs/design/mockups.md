# Internal assets

We've put what we can into the public repo. However, some things from
design are elsewhere, since it was easier for design to use tools like
Google Drive & Invision.

All raw design assets are kept in the [Data Labs Team Drive under "User
Experience/UX &
UI](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1kN5-MbDUGK1YdSw430T_mDhdQdPzGCms).
Most are in Sketch format.

UI devs working at Wellcome should also be to view these files (at least
as of time of upload) in
[invision](https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main?origin=v7#/projects/prototypes/17303255).
