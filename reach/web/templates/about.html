          <p>Reach was developed to improve understanding of the use of research in policy. We have chosen organisations that are influential health policy voices in the UK or at the global level.</p>

          <div class="text-center"><h3 class="category-title">What are the policy sources?</h3></div>
          <p>We source policy documents from UNICEF, Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF), National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the UK government and the UK parliament. The documents include Reports, Health Technology Assessments, guidelines and position papers. If there are any sources you think are missing, please get in touch with the team at <a href="mailto:reach@wellcome.ac.uk">reach@wellcome.ac.uk</a></p>

          <div class="text-center"><h3 class="category-title">What are the scientific publications?</h3></div>
          <p>We use the <a href="https://europepmc.org/">EPMC database</a> to cross-reference the references that Reach finds in policy documents. If a paper is not in EPMC then it will not be reported by Reach even if it has been cited. Click here to find more about How Reach Works.</p>

            <p>Reach is powered by cutting edge machine learning techniques applied by the data scientists in Wellcome Data Labs. Machine learning is not 100% accurate because it is based on probability, but we are constantly working on Reach to improve its accuracy.
